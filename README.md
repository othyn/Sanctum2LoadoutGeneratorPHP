Sanctum 2 Loadout Generator, this time in PHP
===============================

_A web version (PHP) of the Sanctum 2 Loadout Generator I wrote in C_

Code is unoptimised and was written months ago, really could do with a complete overhaul, but, it was only a fun project for a
friend to use, so what the hey. Should really break the page off from the PHP and run an AJAX call on the button, to make the
experience for the end user smoother, again - will look at it in future.
